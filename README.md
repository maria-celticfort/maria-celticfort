Hi! I’m María 👋

I´m a Web Apps Development student based in Galicia ☂️ 

I love coding, even more if I have to use Python or PHP ❤️👩‍💻

Furthemore, I like everything related with database managment and Cybersecurity 🖥️🔒

Right now, I am ~~messing around with Laravel~~ coding my Web Apps Development final project with Laravel 👩🎓

I use <a href= "https://gitmoji.dev"> gitmoji</a> in my commits  ⚡️

Oh yeah! I almost forgot, my name literally means María Celtic-fort Above. I don´t blame you if you are laughing, I also do. 🤷‍♀️
