Hi! I’m María 👋

I´m a Web Apps Development student based in Galicia ☂️ 

I love coding, even more if I have to use Python or PHP ❤️👩‍💻

Furthemore, I like everything related with database managment and Cibersecurity 🖥️🔒

Right now, I am experimenting with Pygame 🧪🎮

Oh yeah! I almost forgot, my name literally means María Celtic-fort Above. I don´t blame you if you are laughing, I also do. 🤷‍♀️
